The goal of bis557 is to have two functions here: one for linear model and another for gradient descent

## Installation

You can install the released version of bis557 from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("bis557")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(bis557)
## basic example code
data(iris)
#The example for function linear_model
linear_model(Sepal.Length ~ ., iris,contrasts = NULL)$coefficients
```





In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
